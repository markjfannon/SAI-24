        "In Lab 1, you have seen that Z3 can magically solve mathematical problems, and you do not need to think about algorithms.  All you have to do is to formulate the requirements in a declarative language.  However you might have noticed that the SMT2 language (that language used by Z3) is not particularly user-friendly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, you will learn how to use Z3 from a Python program (without the SMT2 language).  The skill you will acquire is not just about this specific combination (Z3 and Python); it is about the concept of using a general-purpose solver such as Z3 from a general-purpose programming language such as Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Python?  While relatively slow, it is concise and flexible which makes it ideal for working with external libraries.  It is a popular choice in applications of machine learning and other AI tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of you might not have experience in Python.  This is OK; knowing how to write programs in any procedural language such as Java and some minimal understanding of the Python syntax will be sufficient for the labs/coursework.  Also, learning a bit of Python along the way will certainly be good for your studies and career."
